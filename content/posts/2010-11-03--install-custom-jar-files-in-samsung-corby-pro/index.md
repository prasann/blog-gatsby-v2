Installing jar applications using Corby Pro is not straightforward. I tried multiple ways and finally found an easy solution !!!

**In your PC.**  
\* Download a jar ( Check whether it will work with Smasung Corby)  
\* Create a HTML file as mentioned below.

<html>
  <body>
    <a href="jar\_name.jar">Jar Name</a>
  </body>
</html>

\* Now transfer both these files to your mobile phone. (Make sure you have both these files in the same location/folder)

**In your Mobile:**  
\* Navigate to your HTML file and click to open it on your browser.  
\* You can see a link on your browser with the Jar Name you specified in the HTML.  
\* Click on the link and you are done !!!
