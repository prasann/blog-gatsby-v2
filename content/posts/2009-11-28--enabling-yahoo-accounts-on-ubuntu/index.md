Only after started using Ubuntu i came to know about the existence of Pidgin Internet Messenger(:P). I was pretty much happy as i it allowed to consolidate all my google and yahoo accounts together as a single IM. But I have to make some small hacks to enable my Yahoo account on Pidgin Internet Messenger (2.6.3)

*   Goto Pidgin Messenger -> Accounts
*   Manage Accounts -> Add
*   In the Basic tab enter Protocol As Yahoo
*   Enter your User name and Password
*   In the Advanced Tab enter the details as shown in the screenshot.

 [![Yahoo settings](/assets/images/posts/enable-yahoo-accounts/thumbs/image1.png)](/assets/images/posts/enable-yahoo-accounts/full/image1.png "Yahoo settings") 

Now you can access your Yahoo account through Pidgin.
