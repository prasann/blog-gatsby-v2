### *About me*

A computer science engineer, with a master's degree in software systems. Builds and runs web applications with various stacks. Self taught geek, loves to work in teams and not a 10x programmer 😕 

### *About this blog*

This blog is a collection of my learning and experiments. Not an exhaustive list, but a fun hobby I have. Don't take these posts too seriously 😅 And I might not bother updating the old posts 🤷‍♂️ 

#### *Blog design*

I started of with Blogspot then moved on to Wordpress. Liked Jekyll so much, built my own workflow and was writing happily for a long time, until i met Gatsby.
Thanks to [Greg]("https://github.com/greglobinski") for this awesome starter [theme]("https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog").
